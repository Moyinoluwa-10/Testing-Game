    <h1>Question</h1>

    <div>
        Esther is a Mathematician who has been living with Cancer for 5 years. She has teo sons( Micheal and Thales).
        She doesn't know how to share her properties between her sons, so she decided to use a game called <strong> "
            Dead and Injured". </strong><br><br>

        Dead means the number is part of the code and in the right place while Injured means the number is part of the
        code but in the wrong place. <br><br>

        She said "
        <ul>
            <li>26340 - 1 injured</li>
            <li>71826 - 2 injured</li>
            <li>86470 - 1 dead</li>
            <li>47356 - 1 dead 1 Injured </li>
            <li>03649 - 2 dead</li>
        </ul>

        And finally she said the addition of the 3rd and 4th digit of the code equals " 6" <br><br>

        With the sons having just 1 trial each, what is the 5 digit code to open her briefcase? <br><br>
