  <h1>Question</h1>

  <div>
    Esther is a Mathematician who has been living with Cancer for 5 years. She has teo sons( Micheal and Thales).
    She doesn't know how to share her properties between her sons, so she decided to use a game called <strong> "
      Dead and Injured". </strong><br><br>

    Dead means the number is part of the code and in the right place while Injured means the number is part of the
    code but in the wrong place. <br><br>

    She said "
    <ul>
      <li>26340 - 1 injured</li>
      <li>71826 - 2 injured</li>
      <li>86470 - 1 dead</li>
      <li>47356 - 1 dead 1 Injured </li>
      <li>03649 - 2 dead</li>
    </ul>

    And finally she said the addition of the 3rd and 4th digit of the code equals " 6" <br><br>

    With the sons having just 1 trial each, what is the 5 digit code to open her briefcase? <br><br>
